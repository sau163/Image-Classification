## Image Classification: Model Performance Analysis

This project involves the application of three machine learning classifiers—Bayesian Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—on the given Image Classification Dataset. The primary goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of these models based on multiple classification metrics, providing insights into their effectiveness in classifying the images accurately.

The models are evaluated using cross-validation, ensuring that the results are robust and not dependent on a particular split of the dataset. After training and testing, the confusion matrix helps in identifying common misclassifications, and the AUC-ROC curves offer a visual understanding of the classifiers' performance across different thresholds.

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of each classifier's performance, offering a benchmark for future improvements in image classification tasks.
